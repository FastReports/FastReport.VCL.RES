This file describes the manual installation of language resources. For 
automatic installation please run recompile.exe, select desired language,
select "Change language" and press "Compile".

1. Remove the following files from the FastReport 4\Lib folder:
- frxrcClass.dcu
- frxrcDesgn.dcu
- frxrcInsp.dcu
- frxrcExports.dcu
  
2. Go folder with desired language and run mk.bat file. This will make 
.pas files from .frc files and copy them to all necessary FR folders.

3. Recompile the FastReport packages (see install.txt file,
  section III or IV). Only frx*.dpk, frxe*.dpk packages need to
  be recompiled ('*' = your Delphi version).
